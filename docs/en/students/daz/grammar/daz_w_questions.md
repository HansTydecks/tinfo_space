# Question Words in German

**Question words** come in many forms in German. In conversation, they help us find out what information the other person wants from us. In this chapter, we'll look at question words more closely.

::: warning Note for German as Second Language Learners
Not every language uses question words the way they are used in German. In Chinese or Turkish, questions are sometimes formulated very differently. If you notice that your language doesn't use question words, it's worth doing more research on the internet.

## Beginner Level
### First W-Questions

We want to start with some W-questions. You probably already know and use many of them. When you go to town, you can ask: "**Where** can I find the supermarket?" or "**When** does my bus come?" These questions probably sound familiar from your own language or from another foreign language. Basically, W-questions are *open* questions, meaning those that CANNOT be answered with "yes" or "no."

|| **W-Question** | **Topic** | **Question** | **Answer** | **Note**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|:mag:| Wo? (Where?) | Place  | "*Where* is the book?"  | "The book is on the table" |   |
|:hourglass:| Wann? (When?) | Time  | "*When* will we meet?"  | "We'll meet on Tuesday."  |   |
|:couple:| Wer? (Who?) | Person/Animals  | "*Who* ate the last cookie?"  | "That was Thomas."  |   |
|:question:| Warum? (Why?) |  Reason | "*Why* did Thomas eat the cookie?"  | "*Because* he was hungry."  | You can usually answer *why*-questions with *because...*  |
|:1234:| Wie viel? (How much?) | Amount, Quantity  | "*How much* did the shopping cost?"  | "54.20€"  |   |

:::tip Exercise 1
Compare with the question words of your first language. **Translate** the question words into your own language. :ear: Listen for question words in conversations and :pencil2: note which questions you hear often.

When asking a question in German, the voice :lips::microphone: gets higher :arrow_upper_right: at the end of the sentence. Listen to these three examples and pay attention to the rising intonation.

### More Important W-Questions
Here are some more W-questions that you hear frequently in everyday life:

|| **W-Question** | **Topic** | **Question** | **Answer** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|:hammer:| Womit? (With what?) | Tool/Method | "*With what* are you writing?" | "With a pen." |
|:house:| Wohin? (Where to?) | Direction/Destination | "*Where* are you going?" | "To school." |
|:book:| Was? (What?) | Thing/Object | "*What* are you reading?" | "A book." |
|:art:| Wie? (How?) | Method/Manner | "*How* are you doing?" | "Very well." |

## Advanced Level

### Complex Question Formations
At the advanced level, we combine question words with prepositions and learn more sophisticated questioning techniques.

### Question Words with Prepositions
German often combines question words with prepositions to be more specific:

- **Wofür?** (What for?) - "Wofür brauchst du das?" (What do you need that for?)
- **Worüber?** (About what?) - "Worüber sprecht ihr?" (What are you talking about?)
- **Womit?** (With what?) - "Womit fährst du zur Arbeit?" (How do you get to work?)

### Exercise 2
Practice forming questions with these combined question words. Try to ask 5 questions using different combinations.

## Expert Level

### Indirect Questions
At the expert level, learn to form polite, indirect questions:

Direct: "Wo ist der Bahnhof?" (Where is the train station?)
Indirect: "Könnten Sie mir sagen, wo der Bahnhof ist?" (Could you tell me where the train station is?)

### Regional Variations
Some question words vary by region in German-speaking countries. Be aware of these differences when traveling or speaking with people from different areas.
