# German as a Second Language - Grammar

Pay attention: each of my topics is divided into three difficulty levels:
1. Beginner
2. Advanced
3. Expert

::: tip Learning Advice
Don't overwhelm yourself. Often it's enough to work through a topic thoroughly at the beginner level. This gives you a good impression of the content and you can come back later for the advanced levels.
