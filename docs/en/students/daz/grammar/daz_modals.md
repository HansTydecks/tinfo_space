# Modal Verbs in German

**Modal verbs** describe the manner **how** something is done in more detail. This way you can describe actions or things you do more precisely. Instead of saying: "I go home" you can explain "I **must** go home." Now the other person knows more precisely what you think. The name **Modal verbs** can be remembered well if you think of the word "mode." When something is in a certain mode (e.g., in a computer game), then it's done in a certain way (two-player mode -> playing together).

## Beginner Level

You already know many modal verbs. "I **must** hurry" or "You **may** not swim there." Actually, you're already a real expert! We want to systematize your prior knowledge step by step.

### dürfen (may/to be allowed to)

Most people, young and old, know this:
- "You **may** not do that!"
- "Dad said that I **may** not do that."
- "I **was not allowed** to drink much cola when I was little."

To be **allowed** to do something means that another person has *not* forbidden you from doing something. Or the other way around: if you *may not* do something, then another person has forbidden you to do it.

To be allowed or not allowed to do something means that you're dealing with a **prohibition** or a **permission**.

|| Prohibition? | May I? |
|---|--------------------------|-------------------|
|:thumbsup:| no prohibition | *you may*       |
|:no_entry_sign:| prohibition    | *you may not* |

### müssen (must/to have to)

Having to **do something** is, after permissions or prohibitions, probably one of the first words we internalize at school. Suddenly you have to be quiet or you have to sit still. You have to help more with household chores. You have to give up valuable playtime for homework. The older you get, the more **duties** come upon you. While as a child you get many **prohibitions**, as an adult you are often much freer. **Prohibitions** then appear in a completely different form. You no longer have to go to bed early, but you have to go to work early in the morning.

|| Obligation? | Must I? |
|---|--------------------------|-------------------|
|:heavy_check_mark:| obligation | *you must*       |
|:x:| no obligation    | *you don't have to* |
