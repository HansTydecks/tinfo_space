# Prepositions/Reference Words in German

**Prepositions** bring one or more things into a relationship. This way we can express ourselves more precisely to convey exactly what we mean to our conversation partners. Prepositions are also called *reference* words. Reference here is another word for relationship. One thing can be related to another thing:
- The dog stands *in front of* the cat.
- The train goes *to* Berlin.
- The dough is made *from* flour.

In this chapter, we'll look at these reference words more closely.

## Beginner Level

Learning and practicing reference words or prepositions in a new language is often very difficult. This is because the rules for prepositions are not always clearly defined. Knowledge from other languages like your first language cannot always be transferred to German.

Nevertheless, some important rules can be summarized well. The following rules cover large parts of German prepositions.

::: info Note
Prepositions can be divided into categories. The categories refer to the use of the preposition.

We want to look more closely at two categories of prepositions:
- **Local prepositions**, prepositions of *place*
- **Temporal prepositions**, prepositions of *time*

### Local Prepositions

The word *Local-* comes from the Latin *locus*, which means something like place, space, or spot. So you can remember the technical term well, because these prepositions are about *how things relate to each other in space*.

#### Common Local Prepositions:

| Preposition | English | Example | Usage |
|-------------|---------|---------|--------|
| in | in/into | "Das Buch ist **in** der Tasche" | Inside something |
| auf | on/onto | "Das Buch liegt **auf** dem Tisch" | On top of something |
| unter | under | "Die Katze ist **unter** dem Bett" | Below something |
| vor | in front of | "Der Hund steht **vor** der Tür" | In front of something |
| hinter | behind | "Das Auto parkt **hinter** dem Haus" | Behind something |
| neben | next to | "Der Stuhl steht **neben** dem Tisch" | Beside something |

### Temporal Prepositions

Temporal prepositions help us express when something happens.

| Preposition | English | Example | Usage |
|-------------|---------|---------|--------|
| um | at | "Das Meeting ist **um** 15 Uhr" | Specific time |
| am | on | "**Am** Montag habe ich frei" | Days of the week |
| im | in | "**Im** Winter ist es kalt" | Months/seasons |
| vor | before | "**Vor** dem Essen waschen wir Hände" | Before an event |
| nach | after | "**Nach** der Schule gehe ich nach Hause" | After an event |

:::tip Exercise 1
Choose 5 objects in your room and describe their location using local prepositions. For example: "The lamp is on the desk."

## Advanced Level

### Prepositions with Cases
In German, prepositions determine which grammatical case to use. This is one of the most challenging aspects for learners.

#### Prepositions with Accusative (Akkusativ):
- durch, für, gegen, ohne, um

#### Prepositions with Dative (Dativ):
- aus, bei, mit, nach, seit, von, zu

#### Two-way Prepositions (Wechselpräpositionen):
These can take either accusative or dative depending on whether there's movement or location:
- an, auf, hinter, in, neben, über, unter, vor, zwischen

**Rule**: Use accusative for movement (where to?), dative for location (where?).

Examples:
- "Ich gehe **in die** Schule" (accusative - movement)
- "Ich bin **in der** Schule" (dative - location)

## Expert Level

### Prepositional Phrases and Idioms
At the expert level, learn common prepositional phrases and idiomatic expressions:

- "**Auf jeden Fall**" (in any case)
- "**In der Regel**" (as a rule)
- "**Von Zeit zu Zeit**" (from time to time)
- "**Unter anderem**" (among other things)

### Regional and Stylistic Variations
Different German-speaking regions may prefer different prepositions in certain contexts. Formal and informal speech also show variations in prepositional usage.
