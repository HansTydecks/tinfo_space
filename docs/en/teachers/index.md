# Page for Teachers

In this area you'll find a variety of information, templates, and considerations. Of course, there's no claim to completeness. This page serves me as a way to sort and structure my thoughts.

Everyone should benefit from the content accessible here. This way we save time and effort. In the best case, our own work improves as well. Materials may therefore be used for private or educational purposes unless otherwise stated. Suggestions for improvement are naturally desired. Here you can find [contact options](/en/about/contact.md).

## Overview

Choose the desired subject in the left menu. The content is provided there in various forms.

:::warning Flexibility Notice
While subpages will not be completely deleted in the future, the site **tinfo.space** is subject to a certain fluidity in design. I therefore reserve the right to reorganize content.
